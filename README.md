# UFOs

## Purpose
The primary aim of this project was to use JavaScript, the most widely used programming language globally, along with HTML and some bootstrapping skills to develop dynamic content. With the help of Dana and the team's combined efforts, a table was created to organize UFO data stored in a JavaScript array, which can filter data based on specific criteria, such as date, city, state, country, and shape.

The table was incorporated into an HTML webpage, allowing visitors to filter and display information based on their interests and preferences. To make the webpage more visually appealing, CSS was utilized to modify its appearance by changing default colors.

## Results
Upon entrance to our website, the user will observe the following:

From there if the user desires, they will be able to use the filters on the left-hand side. They can search for any state, city, country, etc. The results will yield on the right-hand side. This also includes duration amount and comments made from the sightings.

## Summary
Although this website allows the users to filter and gather information quickly, it does have some drawbacks. For example, the website doesn't have information past 2010 which may be a negative for some clients who like to stay up-to-date on UFO sightings. I would also include a submission form for anyone to submit a UFO sighting and have it be reviewed before being published onto the site. In addition to this, I think capitalizing state, country, shape, and city names will make the website look more reputable. Lastly, I would add videos and images attached alongside each sighting so the users experience will be enhanced.
