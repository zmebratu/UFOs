# UFOs

## Purpose
The primary aim of this project was to use JavaScript, the most widely used programming language globally, along with HTML and some bootstrapping skills to develop dynamic content. With the help of Dana and the team's combined efforts, a table was created to organize UFO data stored in a JavaScript array, which can filter data based on specific criteria, such as date, city, state, country, and shape.

The table was incorporated into an HTML webpage, allowing visitors to filter and display information based on their interests and preferences. To make the webpage more visually appealing, CSS was utilized to modify its appearance by changing default colors.

## Results
Upon entrance to our website, the user will observe the following:

From there if the user desires, they will be able to use the filters on the left-hand side. They can search for any state, city, country, etc. The results will yield on the right-hand side. This also includes duration amount and comments made from the sightings.

## Summary
While this website offers the benefit of quickly filtering and accessing information, there are some limitations that must be acknowledged. One such issue is that the website only contains data up to 2010, which could be considered a disadvantage for users who want to stay current with UFO sightings. To address this, I would suggest including a submission form for users to submit their own sightings, which can be reviewed and added to the site.

Additionally, I recommend capitalizing the names of states, countries, shapes, and cities to lend more credibility to the website. Finally, enhancing the user experience by adding videos and images for each sighting would be a valuable addition to the website.
